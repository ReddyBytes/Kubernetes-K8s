# CrassLoopBackOffError: 
This indicates the state of pod .  
Means your pod is crashed so many times in a loop   
Lets understand the below flow chart

image is present in dockerhub now create deployment.yml file to deploy our applicarion in k8s

API Server----> Scheduler ---> Kubelet ---> Pod

__Backoff__ means   
container running   ----> container crashes ---->wait 10 sec then retry  --- > again crashes ----> waits 20 sec then retry --- > again crashes ---> waits 40 sec then retry --->until this wait time reaches 5min   

This behavior is known as Backoff

## Common Causes for CrashLoopBackoffError

### Application Errors

Unhandled exceptions or errors during the application's startup phase can lead to immediate crashes.  
see the [yaml file here ](/Error_Handling/2_CrashLoopBackOffError/1_Application_errors.yml) 

### Resource Limits Exceeded

Containers exceeding their allocated CPU or memory limits may be terminated by Kubernetes, leading to a crash loop.  
see the [yaml file here ](/Error_Handling/2_CrashLoopBackOffError/2_Resource_limited.yml) 

### Missing Dependencies

Failure to start due to unavailable or incorrectly configured dependencies.  
see the [yaml file here ](/Error_Handling/2_CrashLoopBackOffError/3_missing_dependencies.yml) 

### Image Pull Errors

Network issues, incorrect image names, or authentication problems with private registries can prevent the container from starting.  
see the [yaml file here ](/Error_Handling/2_CrashLoopBackOffError/4_imagepull_errors.yml) 

### Volume Mounting Issues

Problems with mounting specified volumes can cause the container to fail.  
see the [yaml file here ](/Error_Handling/2_CrashLoopBackOffError/5_volume_mount_error.yml) 

### Port Conflicts

Attempting to bind to a port already in use can result in a failed start.  
see the [yaml file here ](/Error_Handling/2_CrashLoopBackOffError/7_failing_liveness.yml) 

### Failing Liveness  
lly to load balancer  
This is a mechanism to find the health of a container in pod is good or not this action is  performed by kubelet.

see the [yaml file here ](/Error_Handling/2_CrashLoopBackOffError/7_failing_liveness.yml) 

### Configuration Errors

Incorrect settings in the pod or container specification can cause immediate exits.   
see the [yaml file here ](/Error_Handling/2_CrashLoopBackOffError/8_configuration_errors.yml) 


## Troubleshooting Steps

### Inspect Logs

Use `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to view the container's logs, which often provide insights into the cause of the crash.

### Describe the Pod

Run `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to get detailed information about the pod, including recent events that might indicate why the container is crashing.

### Check Resource Usage

Ensure the container's resource requests and limits are appropriately set and that the node has sufficient resources.

### Review Application Configuration

Verify that the application's configuration is correct and that all dependencies are properly specified.

### Examine Image Pull Policy

If using a private registry, ensure the `imagePullSecrets` are correctly configured and that the image name is accurate.

### Investigate Volume Configurations

Confirm that all specified volumes can be successfully mounted and that the paths exist.

### Analyze Probe Settings

Review the liveness and readiness probe configurations to ensure they accurately reflect the container's startup and operational states.

### Review Container Specifications

Look for any typos or misconfigurations in the container's specifications, such as incorrect ports or command-line arguments.
